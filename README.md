# Basic timers app

This is a basic app that allows you to set multiple timers and optionally name them. I made it to practice using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). I imagine it could be useful for cooking, but it can be used for whatever. To view the app visit [cookingtimers.net](https://cookingtimers.net/).
